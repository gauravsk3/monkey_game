This game will fall under the genre of Fighting Game, as it is about the noble quest of a young chimpanzee to take back the rule of the forest from a giant, evil gorilla. The goal of this game is to fight and defeat the evil rulerâ€™s guardian baboons in the early stage as well as the gorilla himself in the final stage. The chimpanzee controlled by the user has the ability to jump (up arrow), punch (D key), and kick (F key) his opponents, and he can move from side to side using the left and right arrows. Along the way, he will encounter an initial level with numerous small, annoying baboons crossing his path, and once he defeats those monkeys, he will be able to face the nefarious gorilla in the final level.
